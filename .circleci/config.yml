      ## walk the tree in orb-releases.yml (the path to which could be fed as a parameter to the command)
        ## For each, attempt to build the orb with the CLI, then if that's successful, register it.
        ## would look something like: `circleci orb build $PATH-TO-SRC $ORB-NAMESPACE $ORB-NAME $PATH-TO-BUILT-ORB; circleci orb register $PATH-TO-BUILT-ORB $REVISION`
        ## Perhaps better yet, the "built" orb has its revision baked in? So then we can look directly for a checksum in our data to match the built orb.
        ## QUESTION: when registering a given "built" orb we can look at the checksum and see if it's different, then increment for them.
          ## If we did that, how would we choose when it's a major, minor, or patch? If we do need to pass it manually, we would want to update the manifest
          ## but, we could allow a request to register be idempotent, so you can send us the same again, and if the revision and checksum are the same as an existing orb it's a noop.
          ## If you send an existing revision with a different checksum that's an error, with a message that revisions are immutable.
          ## If you send a revision smaller than what's live, that an error
